Known Issues
-------------
* After a system reboot or power cycle of a HD-MD4x1 -
  The affected 4x1 can become stuck in a NULL state in which
  it will not switch to HDMI 1 until another input is selected first.
  This could possibly be caused by the excesive number of
  HD-MD4x1's that are all on the same network being managed
  by the same processor.
